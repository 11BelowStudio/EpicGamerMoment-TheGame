**OKAY SO BASICALLY THESE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS**

    You are an epic gamer, who must resist the urge to say The Gamer Word for as long as possible.

* WHAT YOU NEED TO DO*

    - Resist the urge to say The Gamer word

* HOW TO DO IT *

    - Balance your GamerCoins, GamerFuel, and GamerEnergy levels to resist the urge to say the Gamer Word.
    - When the urge to say the Gamer Word reaches 100, that's game over!

    - You can get GamerCoins by working
        but doing this costs GamerEnergy!
    - You can get GamerEnergy by eating GamerFuel
       but this consumes GamerFuel!
    - You can get GamerFuel by buying GamerFuel
        but this consumes GamerEnergy and GamerCoins!

    - You can resist the urge to say the Gamer Word by playing bideo game
       but this consumes GamerEnergy!

    - Alternatively you can just procrastinate, which consumes nothing, but gives you nothing.

    so yeah see how long you can last!
